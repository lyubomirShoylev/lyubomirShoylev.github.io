Welcome to my webpage!

I am a third-year physics student at the University of Oxford. My interests are in the area of astrophysics.

Before coming to university, I was a student at the High School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences in Burgas, Bulgaria. During high school, I was an active participant in science olympiads. I achieved success in the area of astronomy and astrophysics, and had the pleasure of participating in [IAO 2017](http://www.issp.ac.ru/iao/) and [IOAA 2019](https://www.ioaastrophysics.org/).

In parallel to this, I have organised and participated in several outreach events in Burgas in the years 2017-2020. I have also taught at the preparation camp for the Bulgarian team for IAO2021.
