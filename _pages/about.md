Hi there, I'm Lyubo!

I am a recent graduate of the University of Oxford in [Mathematical and Theoretical Physics](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematical-and-theoretical-physics). I am currently interested in gravitation and gauge theories and studying their geometrical aspects. My plan is to pursue a doctorate in the field. More about my master's thesis [here]({% link _pages/projects.md %}).

I am also passionate about teaching and outreach in Physics and Astronomy. I have taught high school students at various stages; more about this [here]({% link _pages/teaching.md %}).
