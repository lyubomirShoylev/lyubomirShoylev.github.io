summary: |-
    I was the co-leader of the group together with [Zorry Belcheva](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/zorry-belcheva#tab-1). The group makes spectroscopic observations of bright stars with semi-professional apparatus.

    During the day, I taught students data reduction for spectra, and during the night I taught practical knowledge about making observations. I also oversaw the work students conducted during the camp.
